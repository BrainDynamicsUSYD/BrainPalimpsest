%
% Deconvolves the 2D responses using the Hybrid Wiener method described in 
% the paper. The method uses a Wiener deconvolution to get the neural 
% activity phi. The obtained phi is then fed to the hemodynamic model to do 
% a forward calculation of the reconvolved BOLD and other responses.
%
% Inputs: BOLD_signal   : array of 2D BOLD signal (x,y,t)
%                         size(BOLD_signal) = [length(distancey), 
%                                          length(distancex), length(time)]                          
%         distancex     : vector of distance along x to get the 2D BOLD_signal. 
%                         This needs to be symmetric with respect to x = 0 
%                         such that x(1) = -x(end)
%         distancey     : vector of distance along y to get the 2D BOLD_signal. 
%                         This needs to be symmetric with respect to y = 0 
%                         such that y(1) = -y(end)
%         time          : vector of time to get the 2D BOLD_signal. 
%                         This needs to be symmetric with respect to t = 0 
%                         such that t(1) = -t(end).
%         params        : instance of the class loadParameters of the 
%                         toolbox
%
% Output: deconvResponses    : structure containing the 2D deconvolved responses.
%                         Possible fields are reconvBOLD, neural, neuroglial, 
%                         CBF, CBV, dHb, Wmode, Lmode, and Dmode.
% 
% Example:
% >> params = loadParameters;
% >> load BOLD_signal.mat                  % assuming the BOLD data is stored in this mat file
% >> distancex = linspace(-5,5,256)*1e-3;  % in mm
% >> distancey = linspace(-5,5,256)*1e-3;  % in mm
% >> time = linspace(-20,20,256);          % in s
% >> deconvResponses = deconvolution_HybridWiener_2D(BOLD_signal, distancex, 
%                                               distancey, time, params)
% >> deconvResponses.neural                % gives out the deconvolved
%                                           2D neural activity

% note for the noise input for the wienerDeconvolution_2D function:
% 1. It is the NSR term in the paper and can either be a single number or a 
%    1x3 vector. 
%       * If it is a single number, the assumption is that we have a white 
%         noise with constant amplitude sigma. 
%       * If it is 1x3 vector, the assumption is that we're using cut-off
%         frequencies, where noise(1) is the 1D spatial cut-off frequency 
%         along x, noise(2) is the 1D spatial cut-off frequency along y, 
%         and noise(3) is the temporal cut-off frequency.
% 2. For now, it's a constant in loadParameters. Change it according to your 
%    intelligible choice.
