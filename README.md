# BrainPalimpsest
Toolbox to deconvolve BOLD-fMRI data and simultaneously obtain 
spatiotemporal images of the neural activity, neuroglial drive, 
cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), 
deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) concentration, and response modes 
W (wave), L (local-oscillating), and D (local-decaying).


Some important aspects before running the codes:
1. Install Freesurfer from https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/
2. Compile inplaceprod.c (in Functions folder) using Matlab C compiler
